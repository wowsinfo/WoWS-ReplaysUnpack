# WoWS-ReplaysUnpack
A C# file unpacking library for World of Warships Replays, inspired by Monstrofil's [replays_unpack](https://github.com/Monstrofil/replays_unpack/).

## Information before using the library
The library supports only World of Warships replays starting with version 0.10.10. 
Trying to use an older replay can result in unexpected errors when processing the replay.

## How to install
Install  [NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget)

Then, install from the package manager console:

```
PM> Install-Package Nodsoft.WowsReplaysUnpack
```
Or from the .NET CLI as:
```
dotnet add package Nodsoft.WowsReplaysUnpack
```

## How to use
Add the service to an `IServiceCollection`
```csharp
services.AddWowsReplayUnpacker();
```
Get the factory with DI, get the `IReplayUnpackerService` from the factory and call the `Unpack` method with either a `Stream` or `byte[]`
```csharp
ReplayUnpackerFactory replayUnpackerFactory = serviceProvider.GetService<ReplayUnpackerFactory>();
UnpackedReplay unpackedReplay = replayUnpackerFactory
	.GetUnpacker()
	.Unpack(File.OpenRead("my-replay.wowsreplay"));
```
## Custom Implementations
You can provide custom implementations of certain services.
```csharp
services.Snippet.AddWowsReplayUnpacker(builder =>
{
	builder.AddReplayController<MyCustomReplayController>();
	builder.WithReplayDataParser<MyCustomReplayDataParser>();
	builder.WithDefinitionStore<MyCustomDefinitionStore>();
})
```
### DefinitionStore
Responsible for managing, accessing and caching the `.def` files (used for type and property mapping).

Your custom definition store has to implement `IDefinitionStore` or extend `DefaultDefinitionStore`


### ReplayDataParser
Responsible for parsing the binary packets to the specific [network packets](Nodsoft.WowsReplaysUnpack.Core/Network/Packets).

Your custom replay data parser has to implement `IReplayDataParser` or extend `DefaultReplayParser`

### ReplayController
Responsible for handling parsed network packets and filling the UnpackedReplay with information.

Your custom replay controller has to implement `IReplayController` but it is strongly suggested to use `ReplayControllerBase<T>` where T is your custom controller class.

To use your custom controller add the type to the `GetUnpacker()` method.
```csharp
UnpackedReplay unpackedReplay = replayUnpackerFactory
	.GetUnpacker<MyCustomReplayController>()
	.Unpack(File.OpenRead("my-replay.wowsreplay"));
```
**CVE Check Only Implementation**
In the library you get a custom implementation ready to use for when you only want to check the CVE .
`CveCheckOnlyController`

It skips all network packets except the affected ones.

You have to add it with the `AddReplayController<CveCheckOnlyController>()` method and get the unpacker with `GetUnpacker<CveCheckOnlyController>()`

**Extend the replay data**
When implementing your own controller and extending `ReplayControllerBase<T>` you can overwrite the `CreateUnpackedReplay` method to create an instance of your own replay class.
The replay class has to extend `UnpackedReplay`. 
That way you can add extra properties.
It is important that you set the `Replay` property so the ReplayControllerBase can work with it.

Example:
```csharp
public override UnpackedReplay CreateUnpackedReplay(ArenaInfo arenaInfo)
{
	Replay = new MyCustomUnpackedReplay(arenaInfo);
	return Replay;
}
```
You can see this in action [here](Nodsoft.WowsReplaysUnpack.ExtendedData/ExtendedDataController.cs)

**Method/Property Subscriptions**
When implementing your own controller and extending `ReplayControllerBase<T>` you can subscribe to `EntityMethods` and `EntityProperty` calls by adding a method with an attribute.

`MethodSubscription("EntityName", "MethodName")`

You have a few extra properties on the attribute to configure how the method will be called:
`bool IncludeEntity` => When `true` it will include the `Entity entity` parameter
`bool IncludePacketTime` => When `true` it will include the `float packetTime` parameter
`bool ParamsAsDictionary` => When `true` the last paremeter will be `Dictionary<string, object?> arguments` / When `false` the parameters have to match the actual packet parameters in order and type exactly. When they don't match you will get an exception telling you the required parameters.
`bool Priority` => Defines the order in which methods are called when you have multiple subscriptions on the same method. Smaller = Earlier. Don't use -1.

Example:
```csharp
[MethodSubscription("Avatar", "onArenaStateReceived")]
public void OnArenaStateReceived(Entity entity, float packetTime, ...)
{
}
```

`PropertySubscription("EntityName", "PropertyName")`

There are no extra properties available and the `Entity entity` parameter is always there.

Example:

```csharp
[PropertySubscription("Avatar", "selectedWeapon")]
public void SelectedWeaponChanged(Entity entity, uint selectedWeaponId)
{
}
```

## ExtendedData Library
You can install the `Nodsoft.WowsReplaysUnpack.ExtendedData` package from nuget to get a ready to use implementation that fills the replay with more information than the default controller.

Currently included in the `ExtendedDataReplay`:

 - Player Information
 - Chat Messages

### How to use
```csharp
services.AddWowsReplayUnpacker(builder =>
{
	builder.AddExtendedData();
});

ExtendedDataReplay unpackedReplay = (ExtendedDataReplay)replayUnpackerFactory
	.GetExtendedDataUnpacker()
	.Unpack(File.OpenRead("my-replay.wowsreplay"));
```
